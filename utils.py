At the beginning, the attacker is assigned a target word, with which the defender is not informed. The task of the attacker is to induce the defender to utter the target word unconciously, then the attacker win the game. However, the attacker is not allow to utter the target word, otherwise the attacker loses.

At the same time, the defender tries to figure out the target word. If the defender identifies the target word, he can say "I know the word! It is `target word`!". Then the defender wins. Remember, the defender can only guess the word once, otherwise he will directly lose the game.

The game has {max_turns} turns. if nobody wins during {max_turns} turns, there is a tie.

Engage in the strategic contest of Adversarial Taboo, a game involving two participants: one assumes the role of the attacker, while the other is the defender.

Initially, the attacker is secretly given a target word, which remains unknown to the defender. The attacker's objective is to cleverly prompt the defender to say the target word without realizing it. If the defender does so, the attacker triumphs. However, the attacker must refrain from saying the target word themselves; doing so results in an immediate loss.

Concurrently, the defender's goal is to deduce the target word. Upon successful identification, the defender may confidently declare, "I know the word! It is 'target word'!" If correct, the defender claims victory. It's crucial to note that the defender is granted only one opportunity to guess the word correctly; any additional guesses lead to an automatic failure.

The game unfolds over {max_turns} rounds. Should neither player succeed within these turns, the game ends in a draw.

Dive into the cunning duel known as Adversarial Taboo, where two contenders face off: one as the attacker, the other as the defender.

To kick things off, the attacker is covertly assigned a target word, which is kept secret from the defender. The attacker's mission is to subtly coax the defender into saying this word without their awareness. Success means victory for the attacker. But there's a catch: if the attacker slips up and says the word themselves, they lose.

Meanwhile, the defender is on a quest to uncover the target word. Should the defender succeed and exclaim, "I know the word! It is 'target word'!" then victory is theirs. Caution is key for the defender, who is allowed only a single guess at the word; any more and they automatically lose.

This mind game is played in {max_turns} rounds. If at the end of these rounds no one has won, the match is declared a tie.

Step into the challenge of Adversarial Taboo, a game for two: one as the attacker, the other as the defender.

Simultaneously, the defender is on a mission to guess the target word. If the defender figures it out, they can announce, "I know the word! It is 'target word'!" and if they're right, they win.

Immerse yourself in the strategic face-off called Adversarial Taboo, where two roles are in play: an attacker and a defender.

As the game sets in motion, the attacker is discreetly handed a target word, which remains a secret to the defender. The attacker's goal is to subtly manipulate the defender into saying this specific word without their awareness, which would result in a win for the attacker. But there's a rule: the attacker must never speak the target word themselves, or they will be defeated.

Concurrently, the defender is engaged in a mental game of detection, aiming to identify the target word. If the defender manages to pinpoint the word, they can declare, "I know the word! It is 'target word'!" A correct identification means the defender wins. It's important to note that the defender gets only one shot at guessing the word; any incorrect guess leads to an immediate loss.

The game unfolds across {max_turns} rounds. If by the end of these turns no one has emerged victorious, the game is considered a draw.
